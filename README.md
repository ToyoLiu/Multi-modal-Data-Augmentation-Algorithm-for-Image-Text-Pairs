### Multi-modal Data Augmentation Algorithm for Image-Text Pairs

**Brief Description:**  
Developed a multi-modal data augmentation algorithm that generates new image-text pairs to enhance data efficiency and model performance in visual-language representation learning tasks.

**Time Period:**  
January 2023 - April 2023

**Tools:**  
Python, PyTorch, NLP (BERT), Vision-Language Pretraining Models (CLIP, ViLT, ALBEF, TCL)

**Key Achievements:**
- Designed and implemented an algorithm that generates new training samples by interpolating images and concatenating text sequences, maintaining the semantic relationship between the modalities.
- Validated the algorithm's performance across various downstream tasks, including image captioning, visual question answering, and image-text retrieval, showing consistent improvements in model accuracy.
- Analyzed the impact of the algorithm on data efficiency, demonstrating significant performance gains, particularly in scenarios with limited data availability.
